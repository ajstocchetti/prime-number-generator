# Prime Number Generator

`prime-stream` contains a brute force prime number generator.

`advanced-prime-stream` tries to reduce the number of times we check if a number is prime.
Instead of incrementing the number by 2 every time, we generate a pattern that we can increment by (`generateSkipList`).
The idea behind this skip list is that, in a very brute force method, we increment our number by 1 and check if its prime. A slightly more advanced method is to jump 2 (once we are past 2), because we know any multiple of 2 will not be prime. But why stop there? We also don't need to check any multiples of 3. Or 5. Or 7.
The skip list is generated by first finding a number of primes, then calculating the pattern we can advance from a given starting point.


Actual results only show tens-of-milliseconds improvements over the brute force generator. Plus, in its current implementation, the advanced generator needs to start at 2 and work its way up, whereas the brute-force generator can start at any number.
